**TL;DR**

My name is Robson William and I'm a creative :bulb: software developer also in development myself :hammer:

## More of a Took than a Baggins

![intelligence](https://media.giphy.com/media/dgUu3sizWUWFG/giphy.gif)

In the LOTR universe, there were several Hobbit families among which were the `Tooks` and the `Baggins`. And as it is described in the *Hobbit* book:

> "Tooks were mainly of Fallohide Hobbit stock, and were **more adventurous** than the other Hobbits."
>
> -- <cite>J.R.R. Tolkien</cite>

So I would consider my software developer profile to resemble the traits of the *Tooks*: Courageous, although not always skillful in everything.

Oh, and of course, I am yet to attain another very interesting characteristic of the *Tooks*:

> "...they were one of the *richer* clans."

> -- <cite>J.R.R. Tolkien

:grin::grin:

 ## Skills

 Ok, enough tales for now, here's the list of my current skills (stuff I'm confident I can do well):

   I'm doing .NET since college and I just love it more and more. Specially after ... of course, **.NET Core**!!!

   * Desktop: WPF, Windows Forms
   * Console
   * Worker Service

    * web API
    * unit tests
    * CI/CD tooling

### Platforms

## Leaning

And here's a list of things I'm actively learning at this moment:

* Rust
* Elixir
* Kubernetes

## Interests 

If I had to name only a few of the things I'm most interested in I would say `Microservices,`, `gRPC`, `IoT`, and `Machine Learning`. 

## What the future holds

I plan to keep my GitHub profile and repositories up to date. I hope we have a change to work together on some interesting project. Here's how to reach me:
